					<br> The rotisserie chicken strikes back!
                    <br> I was craving curry noodles the other day because my mom makes it at home. So naturally, I had to try making it myself.
                    <br> This meal was almost a flop, but being the amazing chef I am, I saved it from flopping. 
                    <br> The issue was that I didn't have any coconut milk to add to the curry paste, so the curry wasn't soupy how I wanted it to be.
                    <br> I ended up making some chicken soup with chicken boullion I had in the fridge and just added it on top of the already assembled meal.
                    <br> I stir fried bok choy, celery, and shallot together with some asian seasonings and added it on top, along with some shredded rotisserie chicken from Costco (a new one ofc).
                    <br> Boyfriend rating: 9/10 :(
                    <br> Critiques: "Because there could have been more meat on there uhhhh let me try to remember bigger portion for a bigger guy"
					<br> Stay tuned for more meals!
